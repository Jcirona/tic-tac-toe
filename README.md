# testing edit

Tic tac toe is an ultra competitive totally balanced game where whoever goes first is totally not at any advantage

## talk about approach to planning

My approach to my plan 

## Cool tech used to add extra features

added sounds to webpage -> added custom made sound effects for clicks

## lesssons you learnt
importance of planning
time management 
be prepared to overestimate the difficulty of some problems and underestimate others


## Update this frequently as you learn new things
Learning how to implement sound into JS
I didn't think I'd be able to create a functional game with all the game logic contained within a single function

## future features you want to add down the line
scoreboard -> implemented this feature
more buttons
different player markers
inputs to enter player name
