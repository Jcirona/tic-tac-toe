# testing edit

Tic tac toe is an ultra competitive totally balanced game where whoever goes first is totally not at any advantage.

## Approach to planning

My approach to my plan was to lay out all the major coding as numbered chunks. They were ordered by the flow of the gameplay and the order in which events will fall
in the game.

## Cool tech used to add extra features

- Added sounds to webpage -> added custom made sound effects for clicks
- Creating the sound assets myself was a fun experience (That music degree finally starting to do some work)
- Added a couple of buttons to reset the board and clear the scoreboard
- Created a scoreboard to track scores
- Used animations on the click functions and the board reset

## Lessons I learnt
- Importance of planning
- Time management 
- Be prepared to overestimate the difficulty of some problems and underestimate others
- Learning how the placement of your code will affect the program

## New things I learnt
- Learning how to implement sound into JS.
- Basic animations in CSS.




## future features you want to add down the line

- Button to change the style of the game.
- Different player markers.
- Inputs to enter player name.
